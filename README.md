/ > Hong Kong is the city when I was a little boy, I wanted to go to where, until recently I wish finally achieved his childhood.
First know Hong Kong begins to know Hong Kong TV series, remember when I first like Hong Kong star is Barbara yung, because "the legend of the condor heroes" the television series ever hit the peninsular and Asia as a whole.
Maybe it's because my childhood is so boring and dull, that I too much infatuated with Hong Kong film star, from Barbara yung, rice snow, dawn to sammi cheng and so on, now let me very want to go to see the stars live what is the secret?
From TV, see I know Hong Kong will be unexpectedly is unreal, can only really feel their experience.
After inquiring about know the most economical way to Hong Kong or group travel, because it is expensive to eat live in Hong Kong, one 5 or consumption should be roughly four thousand to eight thousand yuan, and join the tourist group can save at least half of the money.
However, have to fly with the team and not arrived at Hong Kong airport directly, but via shenzhen special zone and then rode out of the mark.
This let me have a little regret, I heard Hong Kong airport is spectacular, but no chance to witness for the moment.
From shenzhen customs to Hong Kong at the moment is very dramatic, is the small mark let us suddenly from socialist society in the capitalist society.
In Hong Kong, with the mainland is two completely different world, his behavior is at this point should be attention, because you are a not careful it may be fined or sent to the Hong Kong court prosecution.
First of all, there can't spit and litter everywhere, be undercover to catch at least also want to sent more than one thousand Hong Kong dollars, and court and was detained for several days.
If you have a bad habit from mainland China along with the gender, I heard that, believe your mouth saliva in Hong Kong will also can't swallow into the belly.
Well-managed, therefore, Hong Kong has been, transportation, public security, the environment management is very perfect.
To Hong Kong is where every inch of my first impressions are very clean, green trees and red flowers appear in all the brilliant luster of the whole city is like a noble, gorgeous socialite, no wonder the laudatory title of Hong Kong and the pearl of the east.
I finally can open the mystery of the Hong Kong, according to the guide it is a city covers an area of only 1070 square kilometers, population of about 6.6 million or so.
In a long time ago, Hong Kong is just a very deserted island, no water and no electricity, so, now Hong Kong's water and electricity supply are on the mainland, and they eat with all imports from all countries, therefore, can see many duty-free shop in Hong Kong, because there is still a duty-free shopping paradise.
Hong Kong's gold and silver jewelry, cosmetics, digital products, expensive watches and dress is really cheaper than domestic, as digital products, mobile phones, laptops, cameras, etc are domestic six of the same goods to seventy percent.
Remember, the cheapest place to buy cosmetics is SASA and yue.
And Hong Kong designer clothes are plenty, that Esprit, Adidas and so on all of these in the mainland to sell more expensive brands in Hong Kong is cheaper to half of the price, as a result, the Hong Kong fully satisfied my shopping desire.
Arrived in Hong Kong on the first day, we visited the exhibition center, bauhinia square, repulse bay, Victoria harbor night scene, Victoria peak and Disneyland.
The most worth mentioning is visited Disneyland. It's a pity that the god doesn't make the United States, go to Hong Kong's first day has been rainy, and GouKe travel arrangements we only spend three hours in the Disneyland.
As a result, the trip to the Disney trip is some tour, however, let me feel worthwhile.
Disney World let me temporarily away from the real world, as if into a wonderful fairy tale kingdom of fantasy.
Into the Disney, wrought iron gate, pure and fresh quietly elegant aroma of clouds, let a person relaxed and happy, then you will see a statue of the whale fountain is happily greet the arrival of the people.
Then, to the sleeping princess gold-plated castle and the garden, believe that every passing visitors can't help to take pictures in succession.
Enter the door of the castle, eyes suddenly enlightened, greeted the American small town street, it is designed according to the typical American town, and full of nostalgic, walk into a shop, usually see a wide variety of goods.
Some monopoly crystal souvenir shops it looks gorgeous, bright is dazzing, feast your eyes.
In this wonderful colorful kingdom, I saw the childhood favorite Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck and winnie the pooh, etc., and you can also enjoy all to pose for pictures with them.
There are many rides in Disneyland, such as the merry-go-round, dumbo, space shuttle craft, roller coaster, and so on, they have no Ocean Park project, very suitable for children to have fun.
Finally, you can also go to theater to watch a Disney wonderful drama performances, the show brings together the Disney stories all the stars to perform together together, very spectacular scenes, a Hollywood theater ostentation and extravagance.
Its stage design effect is better than the CCTV Spring Festival gala out many times, the children favorite animated character as completely as jumped out and stand on the stage, such as unreal scene really let a person feel the scene.
At this point, I have been moved to universal, as though you were a boy again, surrounded by mountains of happiness tightly.
In Hong Kong for three days later went to macau, from Hong Kong to macau by vessel in the past, that is spent more than an hour.
Macao and Hong Kong across the sea, only 60 kilometers.
If Hong Kong is only one slap so big, so big that Macao is equivalent to one finger.
Macao population density of the world, the average has a population of about 20000 people per square kilometer, but it won't appear chaotic transport scenes, because it as cars are one-way road, and Hong Kong.
Macau's economy is still mainly rely on tourism industry, it is not like Hong Kong, city building and some down.
Heard that because of the Portuguese governance, also don't make what construction, they left also spent nearly all of the macau financial revenue of the money.
To macau everyone small bet a, even I am no exception, perhaps because of his good luck, win a little money after a happy to eat a delicious food taken late at night.
Temptation is particularly big, residents living in macau gambling and prostitution because there are the most developed, and all legal, people can live a life of dissipation life every day.
I still have some good celebration did not live in the city of macau, suddenly feel is our socialism is good ah, here you will feel very deep, you look at the road of capitalism are narrow path.or, while our socialism is full of sunshine avenue.
Because, the two cities of Hong Kong and Macao area is small, since numerous high-rise buildings are jammed, the rest of the road is very narrow, straight depressing to breath.
Want to want to go, still feel live in the city is the best.
Although it's not the flourishing and prosperity of Hong Kong, also does not have the night life rich and colorful, but it is the most suitable for the place where I live.
Hurried over six days journey, I finally returned to his city, suddenly feel particularly comfortable!
To is, I'm still a little bit, do not violate the will of god, - luck is placed we become the couple, isn't that a pair of, is, don't be emotional still let it forever in the heart.
